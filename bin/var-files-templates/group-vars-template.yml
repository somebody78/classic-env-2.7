# Suffixes for BD and EPG are automatically added when deploying. The other suffixes are just for reference
# Adjust to your setup if needed, especially the "domain_name". This domain is used when creating EPGs.
# In ports_tdn you can define groups of ports. This ports can be later attached to EPGs by referencing the name, e.g. "cluster1".
# In this example there a 2 groups. "cluster1" covers the 2 nodes of a firewall cluster, each node connected to 2 leafs with an vPC.
# The "server-group1" contains there specific switchports. You can add more groups here if needed.
